# Employee Turnover Prediction in R
Data science project using a logistic regression model in R to predict employee turnover.

## Contextual Overview

Why is employee turnover important? <br>

Employee turnover, the rate at which employees leave and are replaced, holds significant importance for organizations. It directly impacts financial costs, productivity, and the retention of institutional knowledge and expertise. High turnover can erode morale, disrupt customer relationships, and challenge talent acquisition efforts, tarnishing an employer's reputation. Moreover, it can hinder strategic initiatives, introduce legal complexities, and impede diversity and inclusion goals. In essence, understanding and managing employee turnover is essential for maintaining a stable, productive, and successful organization.

## Project Objectives

1. Calculate the turnover rate and explore it across different dimensions.
2. Identify talent segments and combine relevant data from multiple HR data sources to derive better insights.
3. Use feature engineering to create new variables and exemplify the concept of information value (IV).
4. Build a logistic regression model to predict turnover while accounting for multicollinearity among variables.
5. Evaluate the accuracy of the model and categorize employees into specific risk buckets.
6. Formulate an intervention strategy and estimate its return on investment (ROI).
