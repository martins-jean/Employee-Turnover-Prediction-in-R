# Employee Turnover Prediction in R
Data science project using a logistic regression model in R to predict employee turnover.

## Contextual Overview

Retaining employees is important for organizational growth. The morale of the firm is usually affected by employee losses, and it costs more to hire new employees than it does to keep the ones you already have. The good news is that businesses can now use data-driven tactics to predict potential turnover and boost employee retention.

## Project Objectives

1. Calculate the turnover rate and explore it across different dimensions.
2. Identify talent segments and combine relevant data from multiple HR data sources to derive better insights.
3. Use feature engineering to create new variables and exemplify the concept of information value (IV).
4. Build a logistic regression model to predict turnover while accounting for multicollinearity among variables.
5. Evaluate the accuracy of the model and categorize employees into specific risk buckets.
6. Formulate an intervention strategy and estimate its return on investment (ROI).
